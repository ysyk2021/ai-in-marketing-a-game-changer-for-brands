These recommendations are based on a variety of factors, such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and search queries. As a result, Amazon has been able to significantly increase customer engagement and loyalty, leading to increased sales and revenue.

Netflix

Netflix uses AI to offer personalized movie and TV show recommendations based on viewing history and ratings. By analyzing user behavior, Netflix is able to suggest content that is tailored to each individual user's preferences. This has helped the company to increase customer satisfaction and retention, as well as drive new subscriptions.

Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola uses AI-powered image recognition to personalize digital ads based on the context of the image.
